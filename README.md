MLOps-chest-cancer-classification


This project focuses on building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for chest cancer classification, leveraging MLflow and DVC for streamlined ML lifecycle management. The pipeline is deployed using GitHub and Docker, with the application hosted in a Flask environment.

Key Components:

Data Ingestion: Importing and preprocessing the dataset.

Preparing Model: Feature engineering and selection.

Training Model: Model training and hyperparameter tuning.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance and generating metrics.

Prediction: An interactive pipeline allowing users to make predictions based on the trained model.

Workflows
Update config.yaml

Update params.yaml

Update the entity

Update the configuration manager in src/config

Update the components

Update the pipeline

Update main.py

Update dvc.yaml

Prediction (Docker Local Deployment)
To allow anyone to run the model locally using Docker:

Step 1: Build Docker Image
bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t chest-cancer-classifier .
Step 2: Run Prediction on Image
bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -v ${PWD}:/app chest-cancer-classifier python predict.py /app/sample.jpg
Replace sample.jpg with your desired image.

ðŸ§  Classes
The model currently supports 2 classes:

malignant

normal

Your training data directory should be structured like this:

css
Copy
Edit
data/
â”œâ”€â”€ malignant/
â””â”€â”€ normal/

To Train the Model 
bash
Copy
Edit
docker run chest-cancer-classifier python main.py
This will:

Ingest and preprocess data

Train the model

Save model to artifacts/

After training, run the evaluation pipeline:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run chest-cancer-classifier python src/cnnClassifier/pipeline/stage_04_model_evaluation.py
Outputs like accuracy and loss will be saved to scores.json.
